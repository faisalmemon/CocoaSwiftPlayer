I have forked this project so I can add accessiblity support to the media player.

### Update August 2018
This code base has been modernized to work with Xcode 9.4.1 and Swift 4.2.
It's a mixed project using Realm using @objc inference (not migrated) so gives a migration warning.
The shuffle algorithm has been modified to work with Swift 4.  Unfortunately the Playlist feature is already buggy by not filtering the playlist down to the selected playlist.  So the shuffle algorithm cannot be demonstrated properly anyway.

The code base has been updated to support accessibility.
